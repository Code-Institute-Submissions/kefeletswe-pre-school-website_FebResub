TESTING

I have tested that this website works in different browsers such as safari, chrone and Firefox.

I confirmed that the header, navigation, about, team, facilities and login are readable and easy to understand.

I have confirmed that some of the features in the website are responsive and work on all screen sizes. The home bar, and about us section are responsive to different screen sizes.

I confirm that all the features of the form are working.






PROBLEMS
 

Kindergarten name located on the top-right corner was underlined. I solved this by adding a text decoration of none.

The background image on the header could not fill in the whole page. This was because the CSS width was in px instead of % percentage

 Team member images coud not align well on the page.
